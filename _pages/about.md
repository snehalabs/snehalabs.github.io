Sneha lab develops state-of-the-art ultrafast time-resolved vibrational, electronic, and sum frequency generation spectroscopies to unravel the mechanistic, kinetic, and dynamical details of photoinduced chemical reactions in solutions and at interfaces.

Our mechanistic studies covering ultrafast (100 fs) and slow (ms) time scales allow for the direct observation of key reaction intermediates and quantify the role of kinetic, structural, and environmental parameters in controlling reaction outcomes.
