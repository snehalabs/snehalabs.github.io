<h4> <strong> Mahima Sneha </strong> </h4>

Dr. Mahima Sneha obtained her Ph.D. in 2018 from Stanford University under the supervision of Prof. Richard N. Zare. Her thesis work which led to the first-ever direct observation of quantum mechanical interference effects in reactive scattering for the gas phase reaction of H + H2 was a finalist for the Justin Jankunas doctoral dissertation award in Chemical Physics. 

Following her Ph.D., she secured a Marie Sk≈Çodowska-Curie postdoctoral grant to work with Prof. Andrew Orr-Ewing FRS at the University of Bristol in the United Kingdom. At Bristol, she gained expertise in ultrafast condensed phase transient vibrational and electronic spectroscopies and led the research on the mechanistic investigation of photoredox catalytic reactions. 

Mahima next joined Prof. Poul Petersen's lab at Ruhr University, Germany, as a RESOLV and Alexander von Humboldt fellow to explore water structure and dynamics at zwitterionic polymer-water interfaces with surface-sensitive spectroscopies.
